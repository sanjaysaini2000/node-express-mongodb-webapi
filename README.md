# Node Express & MongoDB Web API

This web api is developed with Node.js and Express to demonstrate crud operations using Mongoose with MongoDB as backend.

## Prerequisites

- In order to run this app, you need Node.js, which is javascript runtime installed on our machine.
  So download and install the latest Node.js available from this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- we also need to have MongoDB installed on the machine. You can download and install MongoDB community edition free from this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community).

- And last, Postman which a famous API Client tool used in testing web API by sending web requests and inspecting response from the API. So download and install Postman for free from this [link](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).

Check out my [article](https://sanjaysaini.tech/create-asp-net-core-3-web-api-using-entity-framework-core/) where I have tested another web api using PostMan. Although web api is different but steps to test any we api are same with PostMan.
